## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.1] - 2026-07-24

Initial scaffold.

### Added

- `YandexMapView` (Android + iOS): declarative camera (`cameraPosition`, `animated`),
  `nightMode`, and the events `onMapReady`, `onCameraPositionChanged`, `onMapPress`,
  `onMapLongPress`.
- `initialize(apiKey)` — runtime MapKit initialization from JS; no `AndroidManifest.xml`
  or `AppDelegate` edits required.
- Expo config plugin: MapKit `version` / `flavor` selection with per-platform overrides,
  and Android `minSdkVersion` 26 enforcement.
- Web stubs that warn once and render nothing instead of crashing.
- Official scoped alias package `@softwhere-uz/expo-yandex-mapkit`.
